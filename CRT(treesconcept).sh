###TREES###
--1.binary Tree
--2.binary search tree
---first node in tree root and last nodes are leaf nodes 
--for node max 2 children and min of 0 children
--full binary tree:-all nodes must have 2 or 0 children
--complete binary tree:-all the levels must be completely fill except the last level the last level has a nodes in left as possible
--2^level for finding the level nodes for each level 
--perfect binary tree:-all the leaf nodes are at the same level & all the non leaf nodes are must have 2 children
--balanced binary tree:-high difference between left and right subtree at any node must be at max of 1
--degenerate tree:-every node has a single child except the last level
##two types tree traversal##:
--bfs (or) level order traversal
--dfs (or) depth wise order 3types
-----1.preorder:-root-left-right
-----2.postorder:-left-right-root
-----3.inorder:-left-root-right

##linked list sort technique by using array code of leetcode
--sort list
--palindrome linked list
