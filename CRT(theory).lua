###GRAPHS###
--two types:-1.directed,2.undirected graph 
--consists of vertices and edges
--minimal condition of graph:it should consists of atleast one node and edge
--graph consists of cycle then it is cyclic graph or acyclic graph
--in graphs their is a edge weight and if edge weight not given for one edge then it by d
--visited array represneted with 1
--unvisited array represented with 0
--graph data stores in adjacency matrix or adjacency list
--adjacency list it takes each neighbours of particular node
